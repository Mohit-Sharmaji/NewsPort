# NewsPort
NewsPort is a NEWS Application powered by NewsAPI.org. It has a minimal application design covering all the categories of News provided by the NEWSAPI.org.

*Important Features & Points*
1) This Application uses Firebase Realtime Database to verify Product_Keys for each individual user at first startup. The Product_Key is used to restrict the number of users who can use the application because we've incorporated API from NewsAPI.org & it only provides 100 Requests/Day for each key in free version.
2) If you wanna Rebuild the application or to use the source code for your own project then you need to get an API key for yourself & paste the key in MainActivity.java file.
3) You also need to connect this project to Firebase Database and add the necessary product keys manually for the users to use.
4) Detailed instructions related to "How does the Project Works?" will be added soon if possible.
